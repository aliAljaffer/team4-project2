# Project 2 - Three-tier app on Azure with fully automated deployment

The main goal is to **fully automate** the deployment of a three-tier web app, from containerization, pushing to a registry (Dockerhub by default), to provisioning the infrastructure required on Azure. This was accomplished using modern tools such as Terraform, Ansible, and Github Actions.

## App Features

1. Images with commit-based tags. Helps to track changes when using commit hashes as image versions.
2. Secure connections using Private Endpoints for the Database layer and App Services. The only public-facing point-of-contact is the application gateway, which takes care of the pathing.
3. Monitoring and Autoscaling ensure the app will react to the workload it's under.
4. Efficient CI/CD pipelines for Docker images, detecting only what tier was changed and performing the appropriate workflow for it, without creating unnecessary copies of images.
5. Cost-efficient scanning using SonarQube hosted on a VM. This VM is provisioned in case of changes to the frontend or backend code, to assist in the scanning step. The last step of the pipeline is to delete this VM, so it's only available during the pipeline lifecycle.
